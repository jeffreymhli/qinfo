Hi! I am Jeffrey, an undergraduate Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto pursuing a specialization in Engineering Physics. I am interested in Quantum Computing, Quantum Information, and Machine learning. All my notes for quantum and machine learning are included in the teaching section.

"[Quantum mechanics] describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And yet it fully agrees with experiment. So I hope you can accept nature as She is - absurd."

-Richard P. Feynman
